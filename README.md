UBLyter is a Jupyter Notebook environment containing all the software code and artefacts necessary to create and maintain interoperability eBusiness Documents modelled on top of OASIS UBL-2.x.

## Requirements

* Jupiter Notebook
* Jupiter Kernels: Python >= 3 and/or Java >= 9 (we use the [OpenJDK-11-jdk](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and the [IJava](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava) package).


## Release notes

### UBLyter v.0.1

The current status of UBLyter is "*_just started!_*". We're producing the Python and the Java versions in parallel. 

The Python version is intended to have a rich and exhaustively documented pipeline that facilitates the hand-over of the maintainance of interoperability eBusiness Documents between development teams in any business domain.

The Java version is intended to have a "quick-to-package" java code. The output of this notebook can be easily integrated in any java application that may need the Cranesoftwright functionalities and into one or several redistributable *.jar files.
